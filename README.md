Certificates of Occupancy are documents certifying that a building is suitable for occupation. They are issued after a building is newly built or after it has received substantial renovations.

I was curious what they looked like, historically, so I looked up a whole bunch of them and made this list of examples.

C of O data goes back to 191?. The 1916 document is the earliest I could find (on the Empire State Building lot, no less), and it's the 212th document in the database, so it'd be tough to find even earlier ones...
